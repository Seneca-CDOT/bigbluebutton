=============
BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system.

 BigBlueButton supports real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with witeboard controls), chat, and the screen.  Instructors can engage remote students with polling, emojis, and breakout rooms.  BigBlueButton can record and playback all content shared in a session..

 We designed BigBlueButton for online learning (though it can be used for many [other applications](http://www.c4isrnet.com/story/military-tech/disa/2015/02/11/disa-to-save-12m-defense-collaboration-services/23238997/)).  The educational use cases for BigBlueButton are

  * One-to-one on-line tutoring
  * Small group collaboration 
  * On-line classes

 BigBlueButton runs on a Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit server.  If you follow the [installation instructions](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/install/install.html), we gaurantee you will have BigBlueButton installed and running within 30 minutes (or your money back :-) ).

 For full technical documentation BigBlueButton -- including architecture, features, API, and GreenLight (the default front-end) -- see [http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/](http://docs.bigbluebutton.org/).
