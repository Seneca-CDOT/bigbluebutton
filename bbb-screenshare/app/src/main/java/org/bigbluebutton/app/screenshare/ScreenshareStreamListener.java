/**
 * Class to listen for the first video packet of the webcam.
 * We need to listen for the first packet and send a startWebcamEvent.
 * The reason is that when starting the webcam, sometimes Flash Player
 * needs to prompt the user for permission to access the webcam. However,
 * while waiting for the user to click OK to the prompt, Red5 has already
 * called the startBroadcast method which we take as the start of the recording.
 * When the user finally clicks OK, the packets then start to flow through.
 * This introduces a delay of when we assume the start of the recording and
 * the webcam actually publishes video packets. When we do the ingest and
 * processing of the video and multiplex the audio, the video and audio will
 * be un-synched by at least this amount of delay.
